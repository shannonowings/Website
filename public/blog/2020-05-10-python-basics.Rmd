# Interaction Between Python and R Studio

In this blog, I will demonstrate an example of how Python and R Studio interact. The benefits of integrating multiple languages are that the strengths of both Python and R studio are utilized and therefore more possibilities are available. To begin, I downloaded the reticulate package in order to allow interoperability between Python and R Studio chunks.

All teenagers lie to their parents. They say one thing, but oftentimes, mean something very different. By communicating with Python and R studio, I will show what a teenager says to their parents (via R Studio) vs. what they actually mean (via Python).

So, what do teenagers commonly tell their parents? 
```{R}
#R code chunk
library(reticulate)

room <- "I'll clean my room tomorrow."
grades <- "I finished my homework."
money <- "Can I have money for gas?"
```

And oftentimes, what do they mean? 
```{python}
#Python code chunk
room="I'll throw everything in the closet."
grades="I'll just use my drop on this homework."
money="I can't wait to buy new clothes."
```

Using Reticulate, we can see both sides of the story
```{R}
#R code chunk
library(reticulate)

cat(c(room, py$room))
cat(c(grades, py$grades))
cat(c(money, py$money))
```
