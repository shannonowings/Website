<h1>Interaction Between Python and R Studio</h1>
<p>In this blog, I will demonstrate an example of how Python and R Studio interact. The benefits of integrating multiple languages are that the strengths of both Python and R studio are utilized and therefore more possibilities are available. To begin, I downloaded the reticulate package in order to allow interoperability between Python and R Studio chunks.</p>
<p>All teenagers lie to their parents. They say one thing, but oftentimes, mean something very different. By communicating with Python and R studio, I will show what a teenager says to their parents (via R Studio) vs.Â what they actually mean (via Python).</p>

<p>So, what do teenagers commonly tell their parents?</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#R code chunk
library(reticulate)

room &lt;- &quot;I&#39;ll clean my room tomorrow.&quot;
grades &lt;- &quot;I finished my homework.&quot;
money &lt;- &quot;Can I have money for gas?&quot;</code></pre>
<p>And oftentimes, what do they mean?</p>
<pre class="python"><code>#Python code chunk
room=&quot;I&#39;ll throw everything in the closet.&quot;
grades=&quot;I&#39;ll just use my drop on this homework.&quot;
money=&quot;I can&#39;t wait to buy new clothes.&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Using Reticulate, we can see both sides of the story</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#R code chunk
library(reticulate)

cat(c(room, py$room))
## I&#39;ll clean my room tomorrow. I&#39;ll throw everything in the closet.
cat(c(grades, py$grades))
## I finished my homework. I&#39;ll just use my drop on this homework.
cat(c(money, py$money))
## Can I have money for gas? I can&#39;t wait to buy new clothes.</code></pre>
